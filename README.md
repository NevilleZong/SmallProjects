# Clock Angle
Solutions in python and java for clock angle problem.

Last update: 17 May 2020

Example usage:\
In python directory:
```
python3 main.py
```
In java directory:
```
./run
```

Currently the program is running an infinite while
loop, which will increase current time by 1 second and re-calculate every angle,
a bit like a show-off mode.

To use it as a clock angle calculator, please comment out current main method
and uncomment the other, which will get a time in string representation
(format: hh:mm:ss) from command line argument.
